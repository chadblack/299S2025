Each of these types of texts, and in many other forms, require thoughtful strategies to place ideas, theories, facts, contexts, etc in relation to one another. This is often the first step into \"historical thinking,\" and thus a skill that must be learned and cultivated like any other skill -- through repetition. This repetition is built in to history classes, but also asks students to be active participants in both reading and discussion. </p> <p>In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can figure out what is important in a set of readings, and then communicate through your own summary what that is and why. </p> <p>Choose one chapter in Fifth Sun: A New History of the Aztecs and summarize it using the form of a pr\u00e9cis and memo. You are aiming fro the most-important aspect of the chapter, and in the memo section you must utilize evidence from the text to illustrate your point. Do not include any additional resources or references. If you use them and cite them, you'll get a Fail. If you use them and don't cite them, you'll be referred for plagiarism! Read and re-read one chapter, mark it up, take notes, and then write you paper.  </p> <ul> <li>Use prose, with paragraphs, as if in a traditional essay.  </li> <li>Include a word count.

They also, of course, make new analyses of documents, bringing new questions, theories, connections, etc. to bear on the past. Evidence must be evaluated, sorted, analyzed in an ongoing process. In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can that clearly and in an interesting fashion. </p> <p>Choose one primary source from the Primary Source folder in Files on Canvas that we have not used in class. Ask yourself what kind of source it is. Who is writing? Why? What are they demonstrating? Read the content, but also beyond the content of the source. Once you've done so, imagine the potential use of such a source in writing a larger essay or book on the conquest. How might the authors we've looked at thus far utilize the source? Then, write an essay describing the source, its context, and its content. Speculate on what more is needed, more sources, more information, etc. to make sense of the source or to confirm it. Begin your essay with an argument-- an argument for why the source matters. But also, articulate what questions and limitations it forces you to confront in your own knowledge. Do not include any additional resources or references except those assigned in class. If you use outside resources and cit them, you'll get a zero.

In this assignment, you will work backwards from a finished piece of historical work to recreate the difficult syntheses at the root of historical research. </p> <p>Matthew Restall's When Montezuma met Cort\u00e9s demonstrates the immense complexity of understanding one discreet moment in time. The webs woven around that moment, the purported face-to-face confrontation between Montezuma and Cort\u00e9s at the entryway to Tenochtitlan, extend not only backwards, to the structures, decisions, and processes that brought the two men together, but forwards into the conflicting, mythologizing, ideological explanations of that moment well into the future. Is it possible to disentangle a point on space and time from this web and isolate its significance and meaning? Is historical truth only retroactively recognizable? </p> <p>For this assignment, you need to choose one chapter from Restall's book and take a deep dive into his endnotes. </p> <ol> <li>To start, you will write a pr\u00e9cis and research memo for that chapter, identifying its primary purpose in the overall structure of the book. (In order to do this, you'll need to read the introduction of the book carefully and understand its overall structure and argument.)</li> <li>Create a categorized bibliography of every source cited in the chapter, pulling from the endnotes. You may develop your own categories based on the mythologizing the chapter is unpacking, but do pay close attention to the years of original publication, clues about the position or country of origin of the original authors, and the role played by the citation in Restall's narrative.  Explain why you divided the sources up the way you did.</li> <li>See if you can locate copies of any of the sources. Very old books can often be found on archive.org,  hathitrust.org, or books.google.com. Other books or articles may be in our own library's collections. Mesoamerican Indigenous sources may have been digitized. (For example, the online version of the Florentine Codex.) </li> <li>Pick a few of those sources, read through or interact with them and compare your own reading to how they're used by Restall. Clearly, he's more capable in this task, but the point is to intellectually exercise and understand how the research develops.  </li> <li>Write up your experience with these sources following the categorized bibliography. What don't you know? Did those sources lead you to others further along the web? </li> </ol> <p>As with previous assignments, use prose with paragraphs for everything except the categorized bibliography itself. Use quotes are part of explaining your own experience with the sources you chose. Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs. Continue to use the same citation style and formatting we've used thus far, including on your bibliography. </p>"},{"location":"Assignment%204/","title":"Assignment 4: Creative history","text":"<p>Historians utilize their knowledge to explore topics more deeply, spread knowledge to other people, and create new ways of understanding the present and the past.

There are five opportunities to complete the four assignments, with the due dates listed below. The goal of this approach is to make sure that you have mastered the historical skills to enter more coursework and your History 499 capstone with a strong foundation. If you work steadily, you'll have the opportunity each time to move into higher, more interesting, and more creative work. </p> <p>To pass this class, you must successfully complete two assignments, attend all classes (with no more than two absences), and satisfactorily complete 70% of in-class work.

The accessibility of data has shifted our collective sense of the nature of knowledge. What does it mean to know something if you can pull the supercomputer out of your pocket and look anything up instantly? What does it mean to write, if a computer can generate convincing text based on probabilistic models of language? You know, bullshit. </p> <p>The biggest threat of machine learning isn't that Skynet will take over the world, but that we will redefine knowledge and learning as that which AI can do. There is significant temptation here, because deeper forms of knowledge require work-- they are active, whether acquired through watching videos, attending lectures, reading texts, writing texts, or doing things. Passive consumption does not work. But all of us are, to some degree or another, lazy.</p> <p>What are the things we do in the practice of History as a discipline of knowledge? At the most basic level, we read, correlate, synthesize, and re-articulate historical evidence. Much of this evidence exists textually-- as archival material, social theory, academic book and journal manuscripts, etc. Some of it exists as material, aural, visual culture. Most of what we work with in class, though, is textual. Historical knowledge is not simply about collecting data, whether that data is story, dates, names, locations, events. Historical knowledge, and by extension understanding, is a synthetic process and an interpretive act. </p> <p>We are going to read a lot in this class. We are going to write a lot in this class. We are going to talk about what we're reading and writing. As simple and predictable as it seems, this structure is still the core of historical work. </p> <p>At the center of all of this is the postulate, writing is thinking. And, both writing and thinking are processes. And if writing is thinking, then what we are doing isn't taking notes, it is making notes. Making notes that help us actively think.</p>"},{"location":"resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/#making-notes","title":"Making Notes","text":"<p>The types of notes we write are predicated on context in which we make them. So, let's divide this into two categories: 1. Readings; 2. In-Class notes.</p>"},{"location":"resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/#readings","title":"Readings","text":"<p>Okay, given all of that, how do you take notes on readings. What is the process? Let's divide this up into a few steps.</p> <ol> <li>Read actively, with a highlighter and/or pen in hand. This is the first form of note-making. </li> </ol> <p>Over the last thirty years or so, researchers have consistently found that reading on paper leads to better comprehension than reading on on screens. In a perfect world, each of you would print out your pdfs and physically mark them up. That is not always realistic. So, if you read on screen you need read on a laptop or tablet. A phone screen is too small to comprehend readings at the paragraph and page level, which is an important part of piecing things together. If you are reading on screen, take advantage of your pdf viewer's ability to highlight passages. On paper, use a highlighter and annotate your thoughts in the margins. Mark sentences that you think are significant for the article-- for identifying its argument and key concepts, categories, and claims at work. Skim when necessary, but stop when you see something worth highlighting.</p> <p>If it helps, imagine ourself in dialogue with the author. Put all of questions or reactions into the notes, annotated by the page or passage that prompted them.</p> <p>Do not cut/paste your highlights into a note file. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Review your annotations. After you finish reading, go back and review your highlights. Do you see patterns? Rephrase the important ones in your own words, but make sure to include the page number and citation with you notes. Synthesize groups of similar highlights into summary notes, but keep track of the citations. Keep individual notes fairly short and focused. </p> </li> <li> <p>Write a pr\u00e9cis and/or research memo based on the notes you've written.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>There is one exception to my warning against transcription-- and that is in processing primary source material in the archive or afterward. This can be even more true when you're working in multiple languages. But, once transcription is done, the same type of note-taking process needs still to be done, if it isn't incorporated into your transcription. </p> <p>Where to keep these notes? This workflow can be completely paper-based. Bring the physical article and your hand-written notes with you to class. It can be completely computer-based. Bring your laptop with the highlighted pdf and your notes. It can be hybrid, with paper copies of the readings and computer notes. Just remember, do not transcribe long sections into your notes!</p> <p>You can use any number of applications to make and keep your notes. Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Microsoft OneNote, and any number of note-specific applications can be effective. They are all most effective when you use consistent file names, so that it's easy to later find what you need. My current favorite is Obsidian, which also allows you to link notes together.^[This website was also written in Obsidian!]</p>"},{"location":"resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/#in-class","title":"In-Class","text":"<p>The rise of PowerPoint and other slide presentation software has changed the lecture, and attendee's experience. And not necessarily for the better. Text heavy slides encourage transcription, and also anxiety over missing out on transcription. But, just as in the section above, transcribing slides (ie, copying verbatim just what is on a slide) does not adequately register the connections in and between lectures in working and longterm memory.</p> <p>Lecture note-making is beneficial in two ways-- 1. the process of note-making; 2. the product of note-making. The first relates to the intake of new information during a lecture, and the second relates to review of notes later. Concentrating on transcribing slides isn't great for either objective. </p> <p>So, during class I would encourage you to take notes actively on paper or in your note-taking software, and to do so in the mindset that you are annotating what we discuss in class. Imagine that you are explaining what I'm saying to someone, or to yourself. Listen for concepts, categories, etc., and write them down as you go. Raise your hand and stop me if you don't understand something or want to clarify that you're on track. Look over the syllabus before class and think about what the focus of the week is, what questions we're working on, what the narrative arc of the semester is. Let that guide you as much as the text on the screen. </p> <p>For exams and essays, if you do this you will have no problem thinking through the prompts because you'll have already been thinking through writing along the way!</p>"},{"location":"resources/films/","title":"Latin American horror films","text":"<p>This is an incomplete list of horror/thriller films from Latin America, and a good place to start for your Presentation Project.</p>"},{"location":"resources/films/#argentina","title":"Argentina","text":"<ul> <li>El Vampiro Negro (1953).

Nemser does this in order to reorient the social construction of race away from bodily difference and to material space and domination, as a means of overcoming the naturalization of difference as a thing upon which race is projected.</p> <p>That's full of jargon, but it makes sense to me based on a lot of previous readings.
