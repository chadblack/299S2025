## Week One: Introduction (Aug 20-Aug 22)

**Tuesday**: Welcome

Reading:  

* This whole website. 

**Thursday**: Horror Media, Horror Method

Our first task this semester is to develop a shared, critical vocabulary to use across the rest of the semester. We'll jump into it this week by asking the question: What do we mean when we say the term *horror*? Resist the urge to make Jones and Cavarero agree, and instead try to read each piece on its own terms. For all of our readings this semester, start by identifying each text's **categories, relations between categories, method, and implications.** Why is the author using these categories, in this way, with this method?

Reading:

* Darryl Jones, "Introduction," *Horror: a very short introduction* (Oxford University Press, 2021): 1-22.
* Adriana Cavarero, *Horrorism* (Columbia University Press, 2011): 1-9.

## Week Two: Monster Theory (Aug 27-Aug 29)

This week, we will extend our reading method to the question of monsters. It is easy to imagine that monster is a transhistorical category-- the category of the scary thing. But, as with horror, the concept of monster is historically specific. What is a monster? Is it a concrete thing, an abstract idea? What do monsters do? What is their utility, and how can we think historically ABOUT monsters, but also WITH monsters?

**Tuesday**: Thinking of Monsters

Readings:

- Martha Few, "Atlantic world monsters: monstrous births and the politics of pregnancy in colonial Guatemala," in Daniella Kostroun and Lisa Vollendorf, eds. *Women, religion, and the Atlantic world (1600-1800)* (University of Toronto Press, 2009): 205-222.

**Thursday**: Thinking with Monsters

Readings:

- Franco Moretti, "The Dialectic of Fear," *New left review* (Nov-Dec 1982): 67-85.
- China Miéville, "Theses on monsters," Conjunctions:59. [https://www.conjunctions.com/print/article/china-mieville-c59](https://www.conjunctions.com/print/article/china-mieville-c59)


## Week Three: On Dreams (Sep 3-Sep 5)

This week and next, we will develop our common analytical vocabulary further through Freud and psychoanalysis, as an introduction to the **symptomatic reading** of monsters, ghosts, and horror. 

Start with a [basic knowledge of Id, Ego, Super-ego, and "return of the repressed"](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/academic/english/theory/psychoanalysis/freud2.html#:~:text=Our%20instincts%20and%20primitive%20impulses,return%20of%20the%20repressed%22). Another encyclopedia-like resource for psychoanalytic concepts: [No Subejct](https://nosubject.com/).

**Tuesday**: Does AI Dream?

- Sigmund Freud, *On Dreams*, James Strachey, trans. (W.W. Norton, 1952): Sections I-V.

**Thursday**: The Dream-Work

- Sigmund Freud, *On Dreams*, James Strachey, trans. (W.W. Norton, 1952): Sections VI-XIII.  
- Sigmund Freud, "The Uncanny" (1919)


## Week Four: Civilization & Its Discontents (Sep 10-Sep 12)

Continuing Freud discussion we now need to understand if and if so, how, social and historical structures get into or at least interact with the drives and dreams (and nightmares) we studied last week.

**Tuesday**: Civilization

- Sigmund Freud, *Civilization and its discontents*, James Strachey, trans. (W.W. Norton, 1961): Sections I-III.

**Thursday**: Discontent

- Sigmund Freud, *Civilization and its discontents*, James Strachey, trans. (W.W. Norton, 1961): Sections IV-VIII.

## Week Five: Horror's Fantasies (Sep 17-Sep 19)

Lots of viewing time this week so plan ahead. Watch _Pervert’s Guide_ first so you can later start trying to figure out some of the errors (or, after Freud, we might say, “naive readings”) of the interviewees in _Room 237_. If you are familiar with _The Shining_, watch _Pervert’s Guide_ then _Room 237_. If you are not familiar with _The Shining_ watch: 1 _Pervert’s Guide_, 2 _The Shining_, 3 _Room 237_.

**Important**: Be careful with the word “fantasy/phantasy” here. It does not mean something opposed to “reality.” In fact, in this case “reality” is produced by, and supported by, “phantasy”–you can find that on page 30-32 of _Civilization & Its Discontents_.

**Tuesday**: The Void 

No class today. I've given you quite a lot to watch and digest, so put class time towards that!

**Thursday**: The Other

Discussion of the films, the interpretive act, and why *Room 237* is a great example of "what not to do."

## Week Six: Modernity's Monsters (Sep 24-Sep 26)

How did the emergence of the gordian knot of Capital, Nation, and State change the monstrous? We will consider this question in final preparation for our primary films of the semester. Read these pieces carefully, and try to understand how the authors structure them, and why.

**Tuesday**: Independence and the Fear of Universal Freedom

Reading:
