###  Week 1: January 21 -- Introduction 

Read:  

* Everything on the website.

### Week 2: January 28 --  What is the Status of the Past?  

What is the status of the past for the present? We're going to start the semester with this philosophical question, first by doing Hegel a bit dirty and reducing him to his late, ill-conceived Philosophy of History. And secondly with the provocations of Walter Benjamin, a German Jewish thinker who wrote his "On the Concept of History" while attempting to escape Nazis.

### Week 3: February 4 --   1492/1992  

1521, like 1492, is a signifier that marks a process and significance that far exceeds the year labeled. At the start of the semester, in addition to asking last week's question on the status of past in general and in theory, we should consider the conflictual nature of this particular history and its memory.
