### Film Presentation Project

For the individual or group project, students will choose a Latin American horror film and reproduce the form of analysis that we have developed over the course of the semester. Students will make a presentation on their film, which should include a short plot summary, still images or clips from important moments of the film, and an analysis of the films pertinent to its important themes. In order to do this, students must also create (and read) a short bibliography of Latin American history work relevant to the film.

For an incomplete list of films, see [this page](https://chadblack.net/2024Film/resources/films/). They are divided by country.

We will schedule presentations for the final weeks of the semester, with each student or group getting 20-30 minutes to explain and analyze their films. Make sure that your analysis is much more *Pervert's Guide to Cinema* and much less *Room 237*. 

Students should schedule a zoom call with Dr. Black during the week of the election to talk about their projects.
