### About

In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and… discovered, or destroyed, conquered, or civilized the Americas. Sixty years later, in 1552, López de Gómara, the private secretary of Hernando Cortés, wrote, “The greatest event since the creation of the world (excluding the incarnation and death of Him who created it) is the discovery of the Indies [i.e. Americas].” He was, himself, a participant the great conquest of Mexico. From the very beginning, not only the magnitude, but also the meaning of the Conquest of the Americas has been a point of controversy and acclaim. Worlds were upended. Millions of people died through the cumulative impacts of warring, labor practices, and, maybe most importantly, disease. Empires were torn down and reconstructed. Christendom was vastly expanded. And, of course, tomatoes, chiles, potatoes, silver, gold, emeralds, horses, cattle, pig, corn, and syphilis traversed the Atlantic in an epoch of unprecedented ecological exchange. Modernity itself was forged in the crucible of Conquest. The readings in this class will take us on a journey through the so-called Conquest of Mexico, from its original Spanish and indigenous chroniclers through current approaches. Along the way we will treat the complexities, myths, and enduring legacies of the process of Spanish conquest.
### Course Requirements

Students are required to engage in this class. Learning is an interactive process, and requires active participation by all members of the class. Students need to read, write, and attend class in order to be successful. These assignments are designed to contribute to the overall objectives of the semester, including both content-specific and skill-based goals.

### Course Objectives

History 299, as an introductory seminar in historical thinking, focuses on developing four skills central to the historian's trade. Our course objectives are based on students demonstrating fluency with each of these skills, using the topic of the Spanish Conquest of Mexico:

1. Students will demonstrate introductory competency in reading like a historian across a variety of textual sources.  
2. Students will demonstrate introductory competency in researching like a historian, developing skills in defining historical questions and strategizing how to approach them.
3. Students will demonstrate introductory competency in writing like a historian, evaluating sources and analyzing them in their own words.  
4. Students will demonstrate introductory competency in thinking like a historian by synthesizing the previous skills.

### Policies

**Accommodations:** Qualified students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be turned in by the end of class on the day they are due, unless otherwise arranged by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted without **prior arrangement**, for any reason. This includes technology problems.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence cell phones during to class. Please do not text during class. Cell phones ought to be put away for the duration of our meetings. Laptops are allowed only for tasks related to this class. Distracting use of technology (social media, surfing, GroupMe chats, etc.) causes problems not only for your own learning, but for those around you. Research shows that analog notetaking improves learning. Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking– both while reading and in class– leads to substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have reason to use your laptop for notetaking, I won’t stop you from doing so.

**Plagiarism and Academic Honesty:** Plagiarism occurs when someone knowingly or unknowingly presents the words or ideas of another person, chatbot, or large language model as his or her own. Any work turned in for this class must meet University standards for academic honesty. Any students unsure about how to apply these rules are urged to consult with me prior to turning in any written work.

**Drop In Office Hours:** Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture, discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses. I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
