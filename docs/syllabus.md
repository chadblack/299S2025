The history of film in Latin America is almost as long as the history of film. Already in 1896, representatives of the Lumiére brothers made and projected films for Mexican President Porfirio Diáz in Chapultec Castle! As moving picture technology spread throughout the world, it radically altered how individual and groups in society perceived themselves, and how they were represented by others. Film (and later television) has been a source of enjoyment, a powerful propaganda tool, a medium of artistic express, a driving force of national identity, and a medium for scary stories.

In this class, we will use horror films, fiction, and historical sources as an introduction to the history and theory of monsters and monstrosity in modern Latin America. In recent years, filmmakers from Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, and Argentina (among others) have used the genre of horror to explore the pressing weight of history on society, through issues such as violence, gender, dictatorship, inequality, and capitalism. In this class, we will interrogate these works historically, not to become exports on horror, but to see how horror and horror criticism provide a method for studying Latin America. 

Most films will be in Spanish with English subtitles. The majority of these films are rated R for strong language, violence, and/or sexual content. These topics (sex and violence) convey the realities of contemporary and historical struggles in the region. In class, we will discuss at length themes in the films that go beyond the casual viewer's interpretations. If, however, you feel uncomfortable with these topics, please come speak to me.

### Course Requirements

Students are required to engage in this class. Learning is an interactive process, and requires active participation by all members of the class. Students need to read, write, and attend class in order to be successful. These assignments are designed to contribute to the overall objectives of the semester, including both content-specific and skill-based goals.

### Course Objectives

1.  To learn to effectively read theoretical and historical texts, and use this information as a basis for media critique.
2.  To learn to identify the ways that film mediates/represents history in its attempt to visually construct its worlds.
3. To understand and use a variety of sources that provide the core of historical inquiry.
    -   Primary written sources, and their particular challenges.
    -   Secondary sources, and how to read them critically.
    -   Visual and physical sources of evidence.
    -   The absence of sources— finding lost voices, and reading against the grain.
4.  To be able to identify, understand, and critique historical argument.
    -   Historians follow a lose set of epistemological, theoretical, and evidentiary rules in their attempts to recreate the limited past that is accessible to us through our incomplete archival record. At the college level and beyond, it is your task to learn how to identify an author’s central argument and to evaluate it based on its evidence, sources, logic, and narrative.

### Policies

**Accommodations:** Qualified students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be turned in by the end of class on the day they are due, unless otherwise arranged by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted without **prior arrangement**, for any reason. This includes technology problems.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence cell phones during to class. Please do not text during class. Cell phones ought to be put away for the duration of our meetings. Laptops are allowed only for tasks related to this class. Distracting use of technology (social media, surfing, GroupMe chats, etc.) causes problems not only for your own learning, but for those around you. Research shows that analog notetaking improves learning. Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking– both while reading and in class– leads to substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have reason to use your laptop for notetaking, I won’t stop you from doing so.

**Plagiarism and Academic Honesty:** Plagiarism occurs when someone knowingly or unknowingly presents the words or ideas of another person, chatbot, or large language model as his or her own. Any work turned in for this class must meet University standards for academic honesty. Any students unsure about how to apply these rules are urged to consult with me prior to turning in any written work.

**Drop In Office Hours:** Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture, discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses. I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
