# Assignment 1: Reading Like a Historian 

**DUE: FEBRUARY 25th**


Historians largely operate through texts, be they the textual remains of the past preserved in archives, contemporary theory, or the historiographic development of works written over time by other historians. Each of these types of texts, and in many other forms, require thoughtful strategies to place ideas, theories, facts, contexts, etc in relation to one another. This is often the first step into "historical thinking," and thus a skill that must be learned and cultivated like any other skill -- through repetition. This repetition is built in to history classes, but also asks students to be [active participants in both reading and discussion](https://chadblack.net/2023SPORT/resources/an%20approach%20to%20making%20notes/). 

In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can figure out what is important in a set of readings, and then communicate through your own summary what that is and why. 

Choose one chapter in *Fifth Sun: A New History of the Aztecs* and summarize it using [the form of a pr√©cis and memo](https://chadblack.net/2023SPORT/resources/how%20to%20write%20a%20precis%20and%20memo/). You are aiming fro the most-important aspect of the chapter, and in the memo section you must utilize evidence from the text to illustrate your point. **Do not include any additional resources or references. If you use them and cite them, you'll get a Fail. If you use them and don't cite them, you'll be referred for plagiarism!** Read and re-read one chapter, mark it up, take notes, and then write you paper.  

* Use prose, with paragraphs, as if in a traditional essay.  
* Include a word count. Your assignment should be between 500 and 750 words.  
* Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs.  
* Information should be presented as a coherent whole.  
* Include at least 3 quotes that illustrate your point.  
* Use footnotes for the three quotes and for any other idea or paraphrase you're referencing from the text. Footnote quotes immediate. Other information can be noted at the end of its paragraph. Use [The Chicago Manual of Style citation guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).
