# Assignment 4: Creative history  

Historians utilize their knowledge to explore topics more deeply, spread knowledge to other people, and create new ways of understanding the present and the past. This assignment gives you the chance to do that. 

You should select and create something that has clear, significant value and a professional appearance, connecting directly to the content of this course. (I.E., it should be about some aspect, issue, theory, myth, etc of the so-called conquest of Mexico.) You should include a 300-500 word commentary explaining your project's goals and how you met them. 

Potential creations could include, but are not limited to:

1. A text-based adventure game using [Twine](https://twinery.org/) that puts players into the conundrum we've thought about this entire semester. 
2. An interactive map and timeline that moves beyond a list of dates and events, but that helps the audience understand the complexity of interpretation over the years.
3. A design for a historical marker that does more than "complicate" or "commemorate" some aspect of the conquest. 
4. A video or written essay on a significant film treating the period that reads the film in the way we've read texts this semester. Good candidates would be 499, La otra conquista, Apocalypse.
5. A curriculum unit for high schools one some aspect of the conquest of Mexico. 
6. A podcast if you want to be that podcaster type.
7. Some other kind of artistic creation that also makes a historical analysis.
