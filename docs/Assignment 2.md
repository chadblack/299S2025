# Assignment 2: Thinking Like a Historian  

**DUE: MARCH 11**


Historians don't only read and synthesize information. They also, of course, make new analyses of documents, bringing new questions, theories, connections, etc. to bear on the past. Evidence must be evaluated, sorted, analyzed in an ongoing process. In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you can that clearly and in an interesting fashion. 

Choose one primary source from the Primary Source folder in Files on Canvas that we have not used in class. Ask yourself what kind of source it is. Who is writing? Why? What are they demonstrating? Read the content, but also beyond the content of the source. Once you've done so, imagine the potential use of such a source in writing a larger essay or book on the conquest. How might the authors we've looked at thus far utilize the source? Then, write an essay describing the source, its context, and its content. Speculate on what more is needed, more sources, more information, etc. to make sense of the source or to confirm it. Begin your essay with an argument-- an argument for why the source matters. But also, articulate what questions and limitations it forces you to confront in your own knowledge. **Do not include any additional resources or references except those assigned in class. If you use outside resources and cit them, you'll get a zero. If you use them and don't cite them, you'll be referred for plagiarism.**  

* Use prose, with well conceived paragraphs.  
* Between 750-1000 words (include a word count)  
* State an argument in the first sentence of the paper; that's your thesis.  
* Include at least 3 quotes from the source.  
* Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs.  
*  Use footnotes for the three quotes and for any other idea or paraphrase you're referencing from the text. Footnote quotes immediate. Other information can be noted at the end of its paragraph. Use [The Chicago Manual of Style citation guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).
