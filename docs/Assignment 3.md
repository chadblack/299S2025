# Assignment 3: Researching Like a Historian  

**DUE: April 1**

Historians work with an enormous variety of information, integrating people, events, broad patterns, theoretical arguments, and more. In this assignment, you will work backwards from a finished piece of historical work to recreate the difficult syntheses at the root of historical research. 

Matthew Restall's *When Montezuma met Cortés* demonstrates the immense complexity of understanding one discreet moment in time. The webs woven around that moment, the purported face-to-face confrontation between Montezuma and Cortés at the entryway to Tenochtitlan, extend not only backwards, to the structures, decisions, and processes that brought the two men together, but forwards into the conflicting, mythologizing, ideological explanations of that moment well into the future. Is it possible to disentangle a point on space and time from this web and isolate its significance and meaning? Is historical truth only retroactively recognizable? 

For this assignment, you need to choose one chapter from Restall's book and take a deep dive into his endnotes. 

1. To start, you will write a précis and research memo for that chapter, identifying its primary purpose in the overall structure of the book. (In order to do this, you'll need to read the introduction of the book carefully and understand its overall structure and argument.)
2. Create a categorized bibliography of every source cited in the chapter, pulling from the endnotes. You may develop your own categories based on the mythologizing the chapter is unpacking, but do pay close attention to the years of original publication, clues about the position or country of origin of the original authors, and the role played by the citation in Restall's narrative.  Explain why you divided the sources up the way you did.
3. See if you can locate copies of any of the sources. Very old books can often be found on [archive.org](https://archive.org),  [hathitrust.org](https://hathitrust.org), or [books.google.com](https://books.google.com). Other books or articles may be in our own library's collections. Mesoamerican Indigenous sources may have been digitized. (For example, the online version of the [Florentine Codex](https://florentinecodex.getty.edu/).) 
4. Pick a few of those sources, read through or interact with them and compare your own reading to how they're used by Restall. Clearly, he's more capable in this task, but the point is to intellectually exercise and understand how the research develops.  
5. Write up your experience with these sources following the categorized bibliography. What don't you know? Did those sources lead you to others further along the web? 

As with previous assignments, use prose with paragraphs for everything except the categorized bibliography itself. Use quotes are part of explaining your own experience with the sources you chose. Organization should be clear, with transitions between paragraphs. Continue to use the same citation style and formatting we've used thus far, including on your bibliography.
