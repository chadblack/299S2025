## Assignments

### In-Class Writing (25%)

Some classes during some weeks will start with a short in-class writing in response to readings or films. The lowest two scores will be dropped, and account for your acceptable number of absences. 

### Theory Paper (15%)

Students will write a theoretical analysis of The Shining as a way of developing their theory of psychoanalysis and horror. 

### Individual/Group Project (25%)

Students as either individuals or in groups will present on a film of their own choosing, analyzing that film with the approach we develop over the course of the semester. Instructions for this project are available [here](https://chadblack.net/2024Film/resources/Film%20Presentation%20Project/).

### Take-Home Final (25%)

Students will write a take-home final paper due at our normally scheduled exam time, in response to a prompt provided by Dr. Black.

### Self Evaluation and Class Engagement (10%)

Students will write a self-evaluation at the end of the semester evaluating their own engagement with the class. What does engagement include? Engaging with the class and its materials can take many forms, including but not limited to:

- **Preparation:** you've read the material before coming to class.  
- **Focus:** you've avoided distractions in class.  
- **Presence:** you've actively participated in small-group and full-class discussions.  
- **Inquiry:** you've asked questions in and out of class on things you don't understand, or that you're curious about.
- **Specificity:** you've used specific ideas from the readings and discussions.
- **Connection:** you've made connections between readings and discussions, and across weeks during the semester.[^1]


Students must keep track of each class they miss during the course of the semester for this evaluation.

!!! warning "Keep Track of Your Attendance"
    For your self-evaluation, you will need to list each class meeting that you missed by date. Please keep track of them. Better yet, don't miss class. If you do have to miss class, give me a quick email heads up.
