## Grading  

This course uses a somewhat uncommon approach to assessment known as Specifications Grading. You have **four** potential assignments, each of which must be successfully completed before you can move on to the next. You will be assessed on each as unsatisfactory or satisfactory. Once you have demonstrated mastery of the standards for the first assignment, you'll be able to move on to the second. There are **five opportunities** to complete the four assignments, with the due dates listed below. The goal of this approach is to make sure that you have mastered the historical skills to enter more coursework and your History 499 capstone with a strong foundation. If you work steadily, you'll have the opportunity each time to move into higher, more interesting, and more creative work. 

**To pass this class, you must successfully complete two assignments, attend all classes (with no more than two absences), and satisfactorily complete 70% of in-class work.** This class meets just once per week, so two absences is the equivalent of between four and six absences in normal courses. 

Beyond that, if you...   
Successfully complete all four levels of assignment: A- to A+  
Successfully complete three levels of assignment: B- to B+  
Successfully complete two levels of assignments: C- to C+  
Successfully complete one or zero: F

Your place within a letter grade range is determined by your in-class work, participation, and self-evaluation at the end of the semester. For example, if you complete all four levels of assignment (A- to A+), your final grade will be determined by your participation in our seminar meetings. 

### Requirements for All Assignments (If you don't this, you get zero credit)  

* Completeness (all required items submitted and questions answered adequately with required evidence)  
* Professionalism in writing quality and presentation: clear organization, no sentence fragments or run-ons, no more than **five errors** per 250 words (including citations in Chicago style)  
* No plagiarism or having AI write your papers  

**Proofreading Tips to Give Yourself the Best Chance of Passing**:

1. Let at least one night's sleep come between writing and proofreading.  
2. Leave yourself plenty of time to proofread.  
3. Proofread with a hard copy of your writing, not just on the computer or phone screen. Errors are just easier to see when printed on paper.  
4. Read aloud as you proofread. If something sounds strange, it's worth revisiting.  

You may only submit assignments on the submission dates. If you get an assignment rejected (and you very well may) then you'll need to get it right on the next submission date, and thus lose your chance at an A. We will be practicing the assigned skills in class liberally before the due dates, but I would also encourage you to meet with me if you have any doubts along the way.  

Our in-class activities will include things like writing pr√©cis and research memos, reacting to readings, working through primary texts together, responding to film, etc. In order to do these activities, you must come to class having already done the reading. This is paramount, and inescapable for a college-level history major.

Historians largely operate through texts, be they the textual remains of the past preserved in archives, contemporary theory, or the historiographic development over time 


### Self Evaluation and Class Engagement (Due May 12)

Students will write a self-evaluation at the end of the semester evaluating their own engagement with the class. What does engagement include? Engaging with the class and its materials can take many forms, including but not limited to:

- **Preparation:** you've read the material before coming to class.  
- **Focus:** you've avoided distractions in class.  
- **Presence:** you've actively participated in small-group and full-class discussions.  
- **Inquiry:** you've asked questions in and out of class on things you don't understand, or that you're curious about.
- **Specificity:** you've used specific ideas from the readings and discussions.
- **Connection:** you've made connections between readings and discussions, and across weeks during the semester.[^1]


Students must keep track of each class they miss during the course of the semester for this evaluation.

!!! warning "Keep Track of Your Attendance"
    For your self-evaluation, you will need to list each class meeting that you missed by date. Please keep track of them. Better yet, don't miss class. If you do have to miss class, give me a quick email heads up.
